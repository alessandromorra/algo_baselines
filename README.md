# Algo Baselines [![CI](https://github.com/lgulich/algo_baselines/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/lgulich/algo_baselines/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Baseline implementations for common algorithms in C++.

The code in this repo will probably not be generic enough that you can use it
for your own problems, but feel free to use the implementations as a guide for
your own implementations.

## Algorithms
