# Algo Baselines [![CMake](https://github.com/lgulich/algo_baselines/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lgulich/algo_baselines/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

Baseline implementations for common algorithms in C++.

The code in this repo will probably not be generic enough that you can use it

your own implementations.

## Algorithms
